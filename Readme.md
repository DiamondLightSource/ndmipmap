#  Mipmap software to downfilter/downsample multidimensional data

**In computer graphics, mipmaps (also MIP maps) or pyramids are pre-calculated, optimized sequences of images, each of which is a progressively lower resolution representation of the same image** 

p.s. A texture with mipmaps occupies 33% more space than a texture without mipmaps.
